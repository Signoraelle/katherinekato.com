    <h1>About</h1>
    <p> I am a creative problem-solver with a positive attitude who enjoys collaborating with others. I love to design and develop in HTML, CSS, and modern front-end libraries/frameworks. I like to challenge my technical abilities in order to continually strive to improve my skills to become better at what I do.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding or pushing pixels, I enjoy spending my free time drawing, reading, and playing video games.</p>
